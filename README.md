## Multilingual Sarcasm Detection in Social Media.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes various data sources to perform analysis and build models within a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). The primary sources used in this project include:

## Data Sources
1. **stop_word.txt** - A text file containing a list of stop words used for text preprocessing and filtering irrelevant words from the dataset.
2. **train.csv** - A CSV file containing training data used for model training and evaluation.
3. **test.csv** - A CSV file containing test data used for performance evaluation and predictions.

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure that all the required data files (`stop_word.txt`, `train.csv`, and `test.csv`) are available in the working directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and execute the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify or extend the notebook as needed to customize the analysis or improve model performance.

## Dependencies
Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries mentioned in requirements.txt before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Notes
- The `stop_word.txt` file is crucial for text preprocessing; make sure it is correctly formatted.
- The `train.csv` dataset should have labeled data for supervised learning tasks.
- The `test.csv` dataset is used to evaluate the model's generalization ability.
